    <br> (I've thought about adding Eminent Domains to this deck, but it's hard enough drawing early, playable assets as is - I'm open to suggestiong, though...)
    <br>
    <br> General tips - The toughest part of this deck is maintaining just enough defense at your HQ while trying to maintain an offensive presence. In general, I'll put the first IC, Commander, & all Armored Corps at my HQ for defense. All the rest, especially the Chandrus, go on offense.
    <br>
    <br> A couple of Chandrus, accompanied by a Sabre-wielding Commander or two, can make short work of most defenses. If you run into a really tough defense, however, use Security Precautions plus Chandru's special ability for an unblockable attack.
    <br>
    <br> (tip - in a mirror match, remember that nothing in his deck can block Chandru when she uses her special ability, so once you have 2 Chandru's, attack one-at-a-time)
