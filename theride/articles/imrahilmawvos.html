    <br> General tips - Get a token defense at your HQ quickly (generally 1 Recon, 1 Trooper, & the Guards), & then go base hunting with a Commander as soon as possible. Protect your line of bases until you can locate your opponent (remember, you're Armored, so he knows where you are from the start).
    <br>
    <br> Once you find him, spend a few turns summoning & deploying as many Mawsons as you can afford. Deploy a Prison Camp at his HQ & start Shackling. It's often possible to win by Shackling your opponent's AT & attacking with the Rangers while the rest of your forces protect your Camp.
